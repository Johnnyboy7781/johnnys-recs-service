# Johnny's Recs Service 💁‍♂️

The backend for [Johnny's Recs App](https://github.com/Johnnyboy7781/johnnys-recs-app)!

An Express.js server that handles request to a Postgres database as well as the Google Places API. Used to populate recommendation data.

## Running Locally

To run locally, follow these steps:

1. Run ```npm i``` to download dependencies.
2. Run ```npx prisma generate``` to generate the prisma client.
2. Run ```npm run dev``` to start the local server.

Your app will then be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).  
That's it! 🎉

*Note*: This service depends on two environment variables to run properly: `GOOGLE_API_KEY` and `DATABASE_URL`.
